# Daily Nutritional Targets

> **Extended Tracking**: See `extended-tracking.md` for comprehensive tracking including sugar, sodium, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, and micronutrients.

## Calculating Your Targets

### Step 1: Calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
- Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

**Activity Multiplier**:
| Activity Level | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| Sedentary (desk job, no exercise) | 1.2 |
| Lightly active (1-3 days/week) | 1.375 |
| Moderately active (3-5 days/week) | 1.55 |
| Very active (6-7 days/week) | 1.725 |
| Extremely active (physical job + training) | 1.9 |

**TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier**

### Step 2: Set Calorie Goal Based on Objective

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|
| Fat loss (moderate) | TDEE - 300 to 500 |
| Fat loss (aggressive) | TDEE - 500 to 750 |
| Maintenance | TDEE |
| Lean bulk | TDEE + 200 to 300 |
| Aggressive bulk | TDEE + 400 to 500 |

### Step 3: Calculate Macronutrient Targets

#### Protein (Priority #1)

| Goal | Protein Target |
|------|---------------|
| Fat loss | 2.0-2.4g per kg bodyweight |
| Maintenance | 1.6-2.0g per kg |
| Muscle building | 1.6-2.2g per kg |
| Athlete | 1.8-2.5g per kg |

**Always hit protein target first** - it's the most important macro for body composition.

#### Fat (Priority #2)

| Approach | Fat Target |
|----------|-----------|
| Standard | 0.8-1.0g per kg |
| Low-fat | 0.5-0.7g per kg |
| High-fat/keto | 1.5-2.0g per kg |

**Minimum**: 0.5g per kg for hormone health

#### Carbohydrates (Fill Remaining Calories)

After protein and fat:
```
Remaining calories = Total calories - (Protein × 4) - (Fat × 9)
Carbs = Remaining calories ÷ 4
```

## Example Calculations

### Example: 80kg Male, Moderately Active, Fat Loss Goal

**Step 1: TDEE**
- BMR = (10 × 80) + (6.25 × 178) - (5 × 30) + 5 = 1,768
- TDEE = 1,768 × 1.55 = 2,740 calories

**Step 2: Calorie Goal (moderate deficit)**
- Target: 2,740 - 500 = 2,240 calories

**Step 3: Macros**
- Protein: 80 × 2.2 = 176g (704 calories)
- Fat: 80 × 0.9 = 72g (648 calories)
- Carbs: (2,240 - 704 - 648) ÷ 4 = 222g

**Daily Targets**:
| Macro | Grams | Calories |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Protein | 176g | 704 |
| Carbs | 222g | 888 |
| Fat | 72g | 648 |
| **Total** | - | **2,240** |

## Micronutrient Daily Targets

### Essential Daily Intake

| Nutrient | RDA | Optimal Range |

| Vitamin D | 600-800 IU | 1,000-4,000 IU |
| Vitamin C | 90 mg | 200-500 mg |
| Magnesium | 400 mg | 400-500 mg |

## Adjustment Guidelines

### Not Losing Weight?
1. Verify you're tracking accurately (weigh food)
2. Reduce calories by 100-200
3. Wait 2 weeks before adjusting again

### Not Gaining Weight?
1. Increase calories by 200-300
2. Add carbs, not fat
3. Ensure consistent eating schedule

### Feeling Weak/Tired?
1. Check protein intake
2. Verify adequate carbs for activity
3. Check sleep and stress
4. Consider micronutrient deficiency

### Protein Target Hard to Hit?
1. Add protein to every meal
2. Include protein-dense snacks (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese)
3. Use protein supplements strategically
4. Front-load protein earlier in day
