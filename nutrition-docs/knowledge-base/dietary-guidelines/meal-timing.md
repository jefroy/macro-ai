# Meal Timing & Frequency

## Overview

Meal timing is less important than total daily intake for most goals. However, strategic timing can optimize performance, recovery, and body composition at the margins.

**Priority order**:
1. Total daily calories and macros (most important)
2. Food quality
3. Meal frequency
4. Meal timing (least important, but still useful)

## Meal Frequency

### Research Summary

- **No metabolic advantage** to eating more frequently
- "Stoking the metabolic fire" with frequent meals is a myth
- Choose frequency based on preference and lifestyle

### Recommendations by Goal

| Goal | Optimal Frequency | Reasoning |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Muscle gain | 4-5 meals | Spread protein for multiple MPS peaks |
| Fat loss | 3-4 meals | Personal preference; protein still spread |
| Maintenance | 3-4 meals | Whatever fits lifestyle |
| Fasting protocols | 1-2 meals | Can work if protein target hit |

### Protein Distribution

For optimal muscle protein synthesis:
- 4-5 protein feedings spaced 3-5 hours apart
- Each feeding: 25-40g protein (hitting leucine threshold)
- Include protein at every meal

**Example Schedule**:
| Time | Meal | Protein Target |
|------|------|---------------|
| 07:00 | Breakfast | 35-40g |
| 12:00 | Lunch | 40-50g |
| 16:00 | Snack | 25-30g |
| 19:00 | Dinner | 40-50g |
| 22:00 | Pre-bed | 30-40g |

## Pre-Workout Nutrition

### Timing
- **2-3 hours before**: Full meal
- **30-60 min before**: Light snack (if needed)
- **Fasted training**: Acceptable, but may reduce performance

### Macros
| Macro | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|
| Protein | 20-40g |
| Carbs | 30-60g (moderate-high GI okay) |
| Fat | Low (slows digestion) |
| Fiber | Low (avoid GI issues) |

### Pre-Workout Meal Examples
- Chicken breast + rice
- Greek yogurt + banana
- Protein shake + oatmeal
- Eggs + toast

---

## Intra-Workout Nutrition

### When Needed
- Training >90 minutes
- Multiple training sessions per day
- Endurance activities
- Hot environments (electrolytes)

### What to Consume
| Duration | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| <60 min | Water only |
| 60-90 min | Water + electrolytes |
| >90 min | 30-60g carbs/hour + electrolytes |

---

## Post-Workout Nutrition

### The "Anabolic Window"

**Myth**: You must eat within 30 minutes or gains are lost.
**Reality**: The window is much wider (several hours), especially if you ate pre-workout.

### Timing Guidelines
| Situation | Post-Workout Window |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Fasted training | Eat within 1-2 hours |
| Fed training | Less urgent; within 2-3 hours fine |
| Two-a-day training | Prioritize fast nutrition |

### Post-Workout Macros
| Macro | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|
| Protein | 30-50g fast-digesting |
| Carbs | 0.5-1g per kg (replenish glycogen) |
| Fat | Moderate okay, not urgent |

### Post-Workout Meal Examples
- Whey protein + banana + rice cakes
- Chicken breast + sweet potato
- Eggs + toast + fruit
- Greek yogurt + granola

---

## Carb Timing Strategies

### For Performance
| Time | Carb Type |
|------|-----------|
| Pre-workout (2-3hr) | Complex, low-moderate GI |
| Pre-workout (30min) | Simple, high GI (optional) |
| Intra-workout | Simple sugars (if needed) |
| Post-workout | Moderate-high GI |

### For Fat Loss
- Place majority of carbs around training
- Lower carb at other meals
- Protein + fat meals for non-training times

### Carb Cycling (Optional)
| Day Type | Carb Intake |
|----------|-------------|
| Training day | Higher carbs |
| Rest day | Lower carbs |
| Heavy training | Highest carbs |

---

## Pre-Sleep Nutrition

### Benefits of Pre-Bed Protein
- Supports overnight muscle protein synthesis
- Prevents muscle breakdown during fasting period
- Casein protein releases slowly over 6-8 hours

### Recommendations
| Macro | Pre-Bed |
|-------|---------|
| Protein | 30-40g slow-digesting |
| Carbs | Optional (no harm, personal preference) |
| Fat | Okay with protein |

### Best Pre-Bed Foods
- Cottage cheese
- Greek yogurt
- Casein protein shake
- Eggs
- Meat + vegetables

### What to Avoid
- Large meals (disrupt sleep)
- High sugar (blood sugar spikes)
- Caffeine (obvious)
- Excessive liquids (bathroom trips)

## Intermittent Fasting

### Common Protocols
| Protocol | Eating Window | Fasting Window |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 16:8 | 8 hours | 16 hours |
| 18:6 | 6 hours | 18 hours |
| 20:4 (Warrior) | 4 hours | 20 hours |
| OMAD | 1 hour | 23 hours |

### Considerations
- **Pros**: Appetite control, simplicity, some metabolic benefits
- **Cons**: Harder to hit protein targets, may impair performance

### IF + Muscle Building
Challenging due to protein distribution requirements:
- Aim for minimum 3 protein feedings even in compressed window
- Prioritize protein at each meal (40-50g+)
- May not be optimal for maximizing muscle gain

---

## Training Day vs Rest Day

### Training Days
- Higher total calories (+200-300)
- Higher carbs (especially around training)
- Protein spread across more meals

### Rest Days
- Maintenance or slight deficit
- Lower carbs acceptable
- Protein still prioritized
- Fat can be slightly higher

### Example Macro Shift
| Day | Protein | Carbs | Fat |
|-----|---------|-------|-----|
| Training | 180g | 250g | 70g |
| Rest | 180g | 150g | 85g |

---

## Practical Guidelines

### Keep It Simple
1. Eat protein at every meal (4-5 times daily)
2. Eat most carbs around training
3. Don't stress minor timing details
4. Consistency > perfection

### Sample Day Structure
| Time | Meal | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| 07:00 | Breakfast | Protein + moderate carbs |
| 10:00 | Snack | Protein (if needed) |
| 12:00 | Lunch | Protein + carbs + vegetables |
| 15:00 | Pre-workout | Protein + carbs |
| 17:00 | Post-workout | Protein + fast carbs |
| 19:00 | Dinner | Protein + carbs + vegetables |
| 22:00 | Pre-bed | Slow protein + fat |
