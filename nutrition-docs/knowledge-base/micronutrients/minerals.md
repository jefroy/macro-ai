# Minerals

## Overview

Minerals are inorganic elements essential for body functions. Divided into macro-minerals (needed in larger amounts) and trace minerals (needed in smaller amounts).

## Mineral Interactions

| Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Calcium + Iron | Calcium inhibits iron absorption (separate by 2+ hours) |
| Zinc + Copper | High zinc depletes copper (keep ratio ~10:1) |
| Vitamin D + Calcium | D enhances calcium absorption |
| Vitamin C + Iron | C enhances non-heme iron absorption |
| Calcium + Magnesium | Compete for absorption (take separately or 2:1 ratio) |

## Electrolytes for Athletes

| Electrolyte | Per Hour of Exercise |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Sodium | 500-1,000 mg |
| Potassium | 200-400 mg |
| Magnesium | 50-100 mg |

Replenish during prolonged (>60 min) or intense exercise.

## Testing Recommendations

| Mineral | Test? | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Iron | Yes | Ferritin test (not just hemoglobin) |
| Magnesium | Sometimes | RBC magnesium more accurate than serum |
| Zinc | Sometimes | Plasma zinc if deficiency suspected |
| Vitamin D | Yes | Most people should test periodically |
| B12 | Yes | Especially vegans, elderly |
