# Carbohydrates

## Overview

Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source. Converted to glucose for immediate energy or stored as glycogen in muscles and liver.

## Types of Carbohydrates

### Simple Carbohydrates
Fast-digesting, quick energy spike
- Monosaccharides: glucose, fructose, galactose
- Disaccharides: sucrose, lactose, maltose
- Sources: fruit, honey, sugar, candy, soda

### Complex Carbohydrates
Slow-digesting, sustained energy
- Polysaccharides: starch, glycogen
- Sources: whole grains, legumes, vegetables, oats

### Fiber
Indigestible carbohydrate, essential for gut health
- Soluble: oats, beans, fruits (lowers cholesterol)
- Insoluble: whole grains, vegetables (digestive regularity)
- Target: 25-35g daily

## Glycemic Index (GI)

Measures how quickly food raises blood sugar.

| Category | GI Range | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Low | 0-55 | Slow, steady energy |
| Medium | 56-69 | Moderate response |
| High | 70+ | Quick spike, fast crash |

### Common Foods by GI

| Food | GI | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Glucose | 100 | Reference standard |
| White bread | 75 | High GI |
| White rice | 73 | High GI |
| Brown rice | 68 | Medium GI |
| Banana (ripe) | 62 | Medium GI |
| Oatmeal | 55 | Low GI |
| Sweet potato | 54 | Low GI |
| Apple | 36 | Low GI |
| Lentils | 32 | Low GI |
| Chickpeas | 28 | Low GI |

## Daily Requirements

| Activity Level | Carb Target |
|---------------|-------------|
| Sedentary/Low activity | 2-3g per kg |
| Moderate activity | 3-5g per kg |
| High activity/athlete | 5-7g per kg |
| Endurance athlete | 7-10g per kg |
| Keto/Low-carb | <50g total |

**Carbs are not essential** - body can produce glucose via gluconeogenesis. However, performance and recovery suffer on very low carb for most people.

## Carb Timing

| Timing | Best Choice | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Pre-workout (1-2hrs) | Complex, low GI | Sustained energy |
| Intra-workout | Simple, fast | Quick fuel if needed |
| Post-workout | Moderate-high GI | Glycogen replenishment |
| Before bed | Low GI or none | Avoid insulin spike |
| Morning | Personal preference | Depends on goals |

## Glycogen Storage

| Location | Capacity | Use |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Muscle glycogen | 300-500g | Local muscle energy |
| Liver glycogen | 80-100g | Blood glucose maintenance |

Depleted glycogen = fatigue, poor performance. Replenish with carbs post-training.

## Carb Sources Reference

| Food | Serving | Carbs | Fiber | Net Carbs |
|------|---------|-------|-------|-----------|
| White rice (cooked) | 100g | 28g | 0.4g | 28g |
| Brown rice (cooked) | 100g | 23g | 1.8g | 21g |
| Oats (dry) | 100g | 66g | 10g | 56g |
| Sweet potato | 100g | 20g | 3g | 17g |
| White potato | 100g | 17g | 2g | 15g |
| Banana | 1 medium | 27g | 3g | 24g |
| Apple | 1 medium | 25g | 4g | 21g |
| White bread | 1 slice | 13g | 0.6g | 12g |
| Whole wheat bread | 1 slice | 12g | 2g | 10g |
| Pasta (cooked) | 100g | 25g | 1.8g | 23g |
| Quinoa (cooked) | 100g | 21g | 2.8g | 18g |
| Lentils (cooked) | 100g | 20g | 8g | 12g |
| Black beans (cooked) | 100g | 24g | 9g | 15g |

## Net Carbs

Net Carbs = Total Carbs - Fiber

Fiber doesn't spike blood sugar, so subtract for effective carb count (important for low-carb diets).

## Carbs and Body Composition

- **Fat loss**: Moderate reduction helps create calorie deficit
- **Muscle gain**: Adequate carbs fuel training and recovery
- **Performance**: Low carb impairs high-intensity exercise
- **Insulin**: Not inherently bad; drives nutrients into muscle cells

## Common Mistakes

1. **Fearing all carbs** - Quality matters more than quantity
2. **Ignoring fiber** - Critical for gut health and satiety
3. **Post-workout fat + carbs** - Fat slows absorption; okay but not optimal
4. **Only counting "net carbs"** - Total carbs still matter for calories
5. **Carbs at night = fat gain** - Total daily intake matters, not timing
