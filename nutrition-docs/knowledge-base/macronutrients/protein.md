# Protein

## Overview

Protein is essential for muscle synthesis, immune function, enzyme production, and tissue repair. Made up of amino acids, 9 of which are essential (must be obtained from diet).

## Daily Requirements

| Goal | Protein Target |
|------|---------------|
| Sedentary adult | 0.8g per kg bodyweight |
| Active individual | 1.2-1.6g per kg |
| Muscle building | 1.6-2.2g per kg |
| Fat loss (preserve muscle) | 2.0-2.4g per kg |
| Athlete/intense training | 1.8-2.5g per kg |

**Example**: 80kg person building muscle = 128-176g protein daily

## Protein Quality

### Complete Proteins (all 9 essential amino acids)
- Animal sources: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy
- Plant sources: Soy, quinoa, buckwheat

### Incomplete Proteins
- Legumes, nuts, grains, most vegetables
- Combine throughout the day for complete profile

### Bioavailability (PDCAAS Score)
| Source | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Whey protein | 1.00 | Fastest absorption |
| Egg | 1.00 | Gold standard |
| Casein | 1.00 | Slow release |
| Beef | 0.92 | Complete amino profile |
| Soy | 0.91 | Best plant source |
| Pea protein | 0.89 | Good plant alternative |
| Legumes | 0.70 | Combine with grains |

## Absorption & Timing

### Per-Meal Absorption
- Body can utilize 25-40g protein per meal effectively for muscle protein synthesis
- Higher amounts still count toward daily total (not "wasted")
- Spread intake across 4-5 meals for optimal MPS

### Timing Windows
| Window | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Post-workout (0-2hrs) | High | 25-40g fast-digesting protein |
| Pre-sleep | Medium | 30-40g casein or slow protein |
| Breakfast | Medium | Break overnight fast |
| Between meals | Low | Steady amino acid levels |

## Essential Amino Acids

| Amino Acid | Function | Best Sources |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Leucine | Primary MPS trigger | Whey, eggs, beef |
| Isoleucine | Energy, recovery | Chicken, fish, eggs |
| Valine | Muscle metabolism | Dairy, meat, legumes |
| Lysine | Collagen, calcium | Meat, eggs, dairy |
| Methionine | Metabolism | Eggs, fish, meat |
| Phenylalanine | Neurotransmitters | Meat, fish, dairy |
| Threonine | Immune function | Meat, dairy, eggs |
| Tryptophan | Serotonin | Turkey, dairy, nuts |
| Histidine | Histamine, hemoglobin | Meat, fish, poultry |

## Leucine Threshold

Muscle protein synthesis requires ~2.5-3g leucine per meal.

| Food | Amount for 3g Leucine |
|------|----------------------|
| Whey protein | 25g (1 scoop) |
| Chicken breast | 120g |
| Eggs | 5 whole |
| Beef | 130g |
| Greek yogurt | 400g |
| Cottage cheese | 300g |

## High-Protein Foods Reference

| Food | Serving | Protein | Calories | Cal/Protein |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Chicken breast | 100g | 31g | 165 | 5.3 |
| Turkey breast | 100g | 29g | 135 | 4.7 |
| Tuna (canned) | 100g | 26g | 116 | 4.5 |
| Lean beef | 100g | 26g | 250 | 9.6 |
| Salmon | 100g | 25g | 208 | 8.3 |
| Eggs | 1 large | 6g | 70 | 11.7 |
| Egg whites | 100g | 11g | 52 | 4.7 |
| Greek yogurt | 100g | 10g | 59 | 5.9 |
| Cottage cheese | 100g | 11g | 98 | 8.9 |
| Whey protein | 30g scoop | 24g | 120 | 5.0 |
| Casein protein | 30g scoop | 24g | 120 | 5.0 |

## Protein Myths Debunked

1. **"Only 30g absorbed per meal"** - False. Higher amounts still contribute to daily total
2. **"Must eat immediately post-workout"** - The anabolic window is wider (several hours)
3. **"Plant protein inferior"** - Can match animal protein when combined properly
4. **"High protein damages kidneys"** - No evidence in healthy individuals
5. **"Protein makes you bulky"** - Calorie surplus + training causes bulk, not protein alone
