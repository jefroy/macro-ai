# Fats

## Overview

Dietary fat is essential for hormone production, vitamin absorption, cell membrane integrity, and brain function. Most calorie-dense macro at 9 calories per gram.

## Types of Dietary Fat

### Saturated Fat
- Solid at room temperature
- Sources: red meat, butter, cheese, coconut oil
- Recommendation: <10% of daily calories
- Not as harmful as once thought, but moderation advised

### Monounsaturated Fat (MUFA)
- Heart-healthy, anti-inflammatory
- Sources: olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds
- No upper limit; beneficial in moderate amounts

### Polyunsaturated Fat (PUFA)
Two essential fatty acids body cannot produce:

**Omega-6 (Linoleic Acid)**
- Sources: vegetable oils, nuts, seeds
- Pro-inflammatory in excess
- Most diets have too much

**Omega-3 (Alpha-linolenic Acid, EPA, DHA)**
- Sources: fatty fish, flaxseed, walnuts, fish oil
- Anti-inflammatory, brain and heart health
- Most diets have too little

### Trans Fat
- Artificially hydrogenated oils
- Strongly linked to heart disease
- Avoid completely (listed as "partially hydrogenated oil")

## Omega Ratio

| Ratio | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 1:1 to 4:1 (Omega-6:Omega-3) | Optimal |
| 10:1 to 20:1 | Typical Western diet (too high) |

**Fix**: Reduce vegetable oils, increase fatty fish and omega-3 supplements.

## Daily Requirements

| Goal | Fat Target |
|------|------------|
| General health | 0.5-1g per kg bodyweight |
| Hormone optimization | 0.8-1.2g per kg |
| Low-fat diet | 0.3-0.5g per kg (minimum) |
| Keto/High-fat | 1.5-2g+ per kg |

**Minimum fat intake**: ~0.3g/kg to maintain hormone function. Going too low disrupts testosterone, estrogen, and other hormones.

## Fat and Hormones

Dietary fat is crucial for:
- Testosterone production
- Estrogen balance
- Cortisol regulation
- Vitamin D synthesis

Low-fat diets (<20% calories) can decrease testosterone by 10-15%.

## Fat-Soluble Vitamins

These vitamins require dietary fat for absorption:

| Vitamin | Function | Sources |
|---------|----------|---------|
| A | Vision, immune | Liver, eggs, dairy |
| D | Bone health, immune | Sun, fatty fish, fortified |
| E | Antioxidant | Nuts, seeds, oils |
| K | Blood clotting, bones | Leafy greens, fermented foods |

Eat fat with these foods for better absorption.

## Omega-3 Sources

| Food | Serving | Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Salmon (wild) | 100g | 2.2g |
| Mackerel | 100g | 2.6g |
| Sardines | 100g | 1.5g |
| Anchovies | 100g | 2.1g |
| Fish oil supplement | 1 softgel | 0.3-1g |
| Cod liver oil | 1 tsp | 0.9g |
| Flaxseed (ALA) | 1 tbsp | 2.4g* |
| Chia seeds (ALA) | 28g | 5g* |

*ALA converts poorly to EPA/DHA (~5-10%). Direct EPA/DHA sources preferred.

## Cooking with Fats

| Fat | Smoke Point | Best Use |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Avocado oil | 271°C / 520°F | High-heat cooking |
| Ghee | 252°C / 485°F | High-heat cooking |
| Coconut oil | 177°C / 350°F | Medium-heat cooking |
| Olive oil (extra virgin) | 160°C / 320°F | Low-heat, dressings |
| Butter | 150°C / 302°F | Low-heat cooking |
| Flaxseed oil | 107°C / 225°F | Never heat, use raw |

## Fat Timing

Fat slows digestion. Consider:
- **Pre-workout**: Limit fat to avoid sluggishness
- **Post-workout**: Some fat okay, but prioritize protein + carbs
- **With meals**: Include for satiety and vitamin absorption
- **Before bed**: Fine, may improve sleep

## Common Mistakes

1. **Avoiding all fat** - Essential for health, especially hormones
2. **Fear of saturated fat** - Moderate intake is fine for most people
3. **Ignoring omega-3s** - Most people are deficient
4. **Cooking with wrong oils** - Use high smoke point for high heat
5. **Fat-free products** - Often loaded with sugar to compensate
