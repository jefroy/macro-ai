## Daily Macro Targets (Cut Phase)

| Macro | Daily Target | Calories | % of Total | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Calories** | 1900 kcal | - | 100% | Highest |
| **Protein** | 170g | 680 | 36% | Highest |
| **Carbohydrates** | 170g | 680 | 36% | High |
| **Fat** | 60g | 540 | 28% | High |
| **Fiber** | 30g+ | - | - | High |

### Why These Numbers

- **High protein (170g)**: Preserves muscle during deficit, increases satiety
- **Moderate carbs (170g)**: Enough for training performance
- **Lower fat (60g)**: Minimum for hormone health (0.7g/kg), allows more carbs/protein
- **Calorie deficit**: ~500-600 below maintenance for steady fat loss

## Limits (Track Daily)

| Nutrient | Target | Upper Limit | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Sugar (Total) | <40g | <75g | Lower limit during cut |
| Added Sugar | <20g | <40g | Prioritize whole foods |
| Saturated Fat | <15g | <20g | Lower with reduced fat |
| Sodium | <2300mg | <3000mg | Watch water retention |
| Caffeine | <400mg | <600mg | Can aid fat loss |

## Micronutrient Targets (Weekly Average)

| Nutrient | Target | Priority | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Vitamin D | 2000-4000 IU | High | Supplement daily |
| Magnesium | 400-500mg | High | Sleep, recovery, often low on cut |
| Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) | 1000-3000mg | High | Anti-inflammatory, brain health |
| Calcium | 1000mg | Medium | Bone health |
| Iron | 8-18mg | Medium | Energy, oxygen transport |
| Zinc | 15-30mg | Medium | Testosterone, immunity |
| Potassium | 3500mg | Medium | Electrolyte balance |

## Daily Schedule

| Time | Activity | Nutrition Focus |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 7-9 AM | Morning | Coffee + protein (prioritize protein early) |
| By 1 PM | Pre-workout meal | Protein + moderate carbs |
| 1:30 PM | Post-meal | Vitamins (multi, D, fish oil) |
| 2:30 PM | Pre-workout | Pre-workout + creatine |
| 3-4:30 PM | Gym | - |

## Supplement Stack

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Cut-Phase Notes |
|------------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Creatine** | 5g | 2:30 PM | Retain during cut for strength |
| **Pre-workout** | 1 scoop | 2:30 PM | Caffeine helps fat oxidation |
| **Multivitamin** | 1 serving | 1:30 PM | Important when calories restricted |
| **Vitamin D** | 2000-4000 IU | 1:30 PM | With food for absorption |
| **Fish Oil** | 1-2g EPA+DHA | 1:30 PM | Anti-inflammatory, satiety |
| **Protein powder** | 25-50g | Morning + post-workout | Essential for hitting 170g |
| **Glutamine** | 5g | Before bed | Recovery, gut health |

## Protein Distribution (Cut Optimized)

Front-load protein to maximize satiety and muscle protein synthesis.

| Meal | Time | Protein Target | Notes |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| Breakfast | 7-9 AM | 35-45g | Start strong |
| Pre-workout meal | 12-1 PM | 40-50g | Fuel training |
| Post-workout shake | 5 PM | 25-30g | Fast absorption |
| Dinner | 6-7 PM | 35-45g | Satisfying end |
| Evening (if needed) | 8-9 PM | 15-25g | Casein/cottage cheese |

## Cut-Phase Food Priorities

### High-Volume, Low-Calorie (Satiety)
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower)
- Cucumber, celery, tomatoes
- Egg whites
- Chicken breast
- White fish (cod, tilapia)

### Protein-Dense (Hit 170g)
- Chicken breast: 31g/100g
- Greek yogurt 0%: 10g/100g
- Cottage cheese: 11g/100g
- Egg whites: 11g/100g
- Whey protein: 25g/scoop
- Shrimp: 24g/100g

### Smart Carbs (Training Days)
- White rice (around workouts)
- Oats (breakfast)
- Sweet potato
- Fruit (bananas, berries)

### Healthy Fats (Limited but Essential)
- Fish oil (supplement)
- Eggs (whole, limit 2-3/day)
- Avocado (small portions)
- Olive oil (measured)

## Foods to Limit During Cut

| Food | Reason | Alternative |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Nuts/nut butter | Calorie dense, easy to overeat | Measure strictly or avoid |
| Cheese | High calorie, high fat | Low-fat cottage cheese |
| Cooking oils | Hidden calories | Spray oil, measure carefully |
| Dried fruit | Concentrated sugar | Fresh fruit |
| Granola | Calorie bomb | Plain oats |
| Alcohol | Empty calories, impairs fat loss | Skip or rare |

## Cut-Phase Tips

1. **Weigh food** - Eyeballing underestimates calories
2. **Protein first** - Build meals around protein source
3. **Volume eating** - Fill up on vegetables
4. **Stay hydrated** - 3L+ water, helps satiety
5. **Sleep priority** - Poor sleep = muscle loss, hunger
6. **Caffeine strategically** - Morning/pre-workout only
7. **Refeed if needed** - Higher carb day weekly if energy tanks

## Notes

- Nutrition day starts at 4 AM
- Discord channel #macros for logging
- Weekly analysis every Sunday at 6 PM
- Expect 0.5-1kg loss per week at this deficit
- If strength drops significantly, consider diet break or refeed
